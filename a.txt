Here's how I was able to pull it off.

First, get access to the file in Mutagen:

audio = MP3("filename.mp3")

Then, get a reference to the tag you're looking for:

picturetag = audio.tags['APIC:Folder.jpg']

Then, modify the type attribute:

picturetag.type = 3

Then, assign it back into the audio file, just to be sure

audio.tags['APIC:Folder.jpg'] = picturetag

Finally, save it!

audio.save()
